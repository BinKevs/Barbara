I loved the journey that the heroine took me, to the island of Keft, and far away lands where the young beautiful bull vaulter grows into a wise woman. This book is a true adventure of the heart and mind with art, passion and culture of ancient Crete. What a great book for my book club.",

Very engaging, Ms Tieken tells the story so delightfully, as a young woman finds herself in several worlds at once, and she models dignity, courage, and Great heart and Wisdom.

            <div className="text-black font-light text-lg ml-8">
              Set in 2100 B.C.E, Bull Vaulter: Alena of the Isle of Green is one
              of those uncommon pieces of fiction literature which features
              convincing insights built on meticulous research – while still
              providing readers a rich and riveting narrative. Alena, the main
              character in the story, is a famous and well-experienced bull
              vaulter of the Keft, an Island across the Aegean Sea. As was the
              custom of the island, every bull vaulter would serve the Goddess
              and participate in the bullfighting ceremony for three years and
              later allowed to choose a life partner.
              <br />
              <br />
              Alena’s love interest was Dorion, the most renowned bull dancer on
              the island. Their plans drastically change when the ruthless
              warrior horsemen living on the plains stage an attack on the
              visiting Isle of Greens bull dancers as they performed on the day
              of the Harvest Festival, that many had gathered to watch
              throughout the peninsula’s coastal villages. Among the injured are
              Dorion and Alena, who are separately carried off as hostages.
              <br />
              <br />
              The incidents that shortly follow the attack, leave Alena
              traumatized, in pain, and unconscious for many days. Jahal, one of
              the warrior horsemen, and heir to the chieftainship of the Kurgan
              tribe takes Alena to the temple of Peloponnesus, where she is
              attended to by Myra and Aesclevius, two life partners and
              priestess healers of the temple.
              <br />
              <br />
              The two believe that Alena has a special calling and both
              encourage her to follow the path laid out to her by the Goddess.
              While there, Alena meets Jahal and is instantly enamored by him.
              Could Alena learn to turn her focus to her inner calling and
              forget her interest and love for bull vaulting? Could her will now
              be intertwined to work as one with the will of the gentle healing
              Goddess? Was her heart willing to forget her former flame, Dorion,
              and let Jahal in, who also had deep secrets of his own?
              <br />
              <br />
              Author Barbara Tieken tells the story in such a delightful manner,
              as young Alena finds herself part of different worlds at once. The
              author has thrust us into a natural world where ancient healing
              arts were treasured. I loved the descriptions used in the book
              that vividly curve out ancient Minoan life and the way of life of
              the people of Peloponnesus.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is a very well-crafted, enthralling story, and a real
              page-turner. It is nearly impossible for readers not to feel they
              are part of the story. Alena is easy to like and understand,
              largely because of her warm-heartedness and willingness to do
              good. Jahal is also an interesting character and readers will
              enjoy reading how he evolves from a selfish and conceited man to a
              caring and tender man.
              <br />
              <br />
              Finishing this book was bittersweet. I couldn’t wait to see how
              Alena and Jahal’s lives would unfold and at the same time, I did
              not want it to end. The book, however, contains adult content and
              some scenes of violence and therefore might be more suitable for a
              mature audience. I heartily recommend Bull Vaulter: Alena of the
              Isle of Green to fans of historical fiction who love elements of
              mythology and a gripping love story at the center.

              "…it was revealed to you in your own serpent healing… ‘A life well
              lived is a death well deserved.’"
              <br />
              <br />
              One horrible night in the ancient Peloponnesus, members of an
              invading tribe double rape a fourteen-year-old girl. The attack
              leaves her injured and pregnant. But Alena is tough beyond her
              years. She is a bull vaulter, rigorously trained to execute
              acrobatic feats on the back of a galloping bull—her matriarchal
              society's symbol of strength and rebirth. Alena's life was about
              to change, anyway. This performance was her last before, like
              other bull vaulters, she gave up bull vaulting to marry. Now,
              though, she is the patient of a married pair of healers who wish
              to teach her their art. After a difficult birth nearly kills her,
              she can fully appreciate their skills. Her physical healing
              inspires her to help others who suffer. Gradually, the affections
              of her mending heart likewise turn to the least likely and, many
              might say, the least worthy object.
              <br />
              <br />
              Matriarchal societies of the ancient world are not frequently the
              subjects of historical fiction. Still rarer is the juxtaposition
              of a society of strong, capable women with one of initially
              domineering men, some of whom eventually grow to respect the
              self-determined women they encounter. Tieken here skillfully
              presents two such contrasting cultures. Kurgan women, from what is
              today Ukraine, are valued far less than horses. Thus, the equality
              of men and women that he discovers among Alena's people astonishes
              young Kurgan warlord Jahal, who nonetheless embraces these new
              ideas about the opposite sex. Jahal undergoes a corresponding
              change of character wherein he softens without becoming weak. This
              book will likely prove an engaging read for those interested in
              the spirituality of matriarchal societies and those who are
              themselves of a spontaneous bent or who admire spontaneity in
              literary characters. The vivid descriptions of scenery, festivals,
              and food might even spur some to travel to Greece.
